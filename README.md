# Weather
![](media/img.png)

## About
A simple weather app demonstrating the MVVM kotlin, Android Jetpack components and kodein, to fetch data from the server and display in the app using the retrofit library.

## Built With ðŸ› 
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - First class and official programming language for Android development.
- [ViewBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) - Generates a binding class for each XML layout file present in that module and allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
- [Kodein](https://kodein.org/di/) - Kodein is a very simple and yet very useful pure Kotlin dependency retrieval container.
               It is very easy to use and configure.
- [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room?gclid=CjwKCAjwwMn1BRAUEiwAZ_jnEgolz5twQ8VDcXxXd3v6ADuBkkrJ6jvOISrlPYxMTOeUiVo-WOpnuhoCZTAQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) - The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) - Glide is a fast and efficient open source media management and image loading framework for Android that wraps media decoding, memory and disk caching, and resource pooling into a simple and easy to use interface.

## TODO
- Update README.MD WITH MORE DETAILS
- Add the forecast weather functionality.

## Credit
This project is built along side watching and learning from Tutorials of [Resocoder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDaaM3u389I&list=PLB6lc7nQ1n4jTLDyU2muTBo8xk0dg0D_w&index=1).
It has shown me how parts of the MVVM architecture fit and work together.
Its simple to understand and his explanations are nice and clear.
I highly recommend it for learning how to implement clean MVVM architecture.
